This project is used to present my skill using Unity DOTs.

Asteroid is a game that you have to destroy as many asteroid as possible.

To play the game use 'W' to accelerate the ship, 'S' to break the ship, the mouse to rotate the ship and shot.

Link to play on WebBrowser. Give preference for Firefox since Unity Engine does not have a great support for Google Chrome.
